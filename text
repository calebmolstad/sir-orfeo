We redyn ofte and fynde ywryte, 
As clerkes don us to wyte, 
þe layes þat ben of harpyng 
Ben yfounde of frely þing, 
Sunt ben of wele and sunt of wo, 
And sum of joy and merþe also, 
Sum of trechery and sum of gyle, 
And sum of happes, þat fallen by whyle, 
Sunt of bourdys and sum of rybaudry, 
And sum þer ben of þe feyre. 
Off alle þing þat men may se, 
Moost o lowe forsoþe þey be. 
In Brytain þis layes arne ywryte, 
Furst yfounde and forþe ygete, 
Of aventures þat fillen by dayes 
Wherof Brytouns made her layes, 
When þey myght owher heryn 
Of aventures þat þer weryn, 
þey toke her harpys wiþ game, 
Maden layes and ȝaf it name, 
Of aventures, þat han befalle, 
Y can sunt telle, but nought all 
Herken, lordyngs, þat ben trewe, 
And y wol ȝou telle of sir Orphewe. 
Orfeo was a king, 
In his time an heiȝe lording, 
A stalworþ man and hardi bo, 
Large, curteys he was also. 
His fader was comen of king Pluto 
And his moder of king Juno, 
þat sum time were as godes yhold 
For aventours, þat þai dede and told. 
Orpheo most of ony þing 
Lovede þe gle of harpyng; 
Syker was every gode harpoure 
Of hym to have moche honour. 
Hymself loved for to harpe 
And layde þereon his wittes scharpe, 
He lernyd so, þer noþing was 
A better harper in no plas. 
In þe world was never man born 
þat ever Orpheo sat biforn, 
And he myȝt of his harpyng her, 
He schulde þinke þat he wer 
In one of þe joys of paradys, 
Suche joy and melody in his harpyng is, 
þis king soiurnd in Traciens, 
þat was a cite of noble defens; 
He hadde wiþ him a quen of priis, 
þat was ycleped dame Heurodis, 
þe fairest levedi for þe nones 
þat miȝt gon on bodi and bones, 
Ful of love and of godenisse, 
Ac no man may telle hir fairnise. 
Bifel so in þe comessing of May, 
When miri and bot is þe day,
Oway beþ winterschours, 
And everi feld is ful of flours, 
And blosme breme on everi bouȝ 
Overal wexeþ miri anouȝ, 
þis ich quen dame Heurodis 
Tok to maidens of priis 
And went in an undrentide 
To play bi an orchardside,
To se þe floures sprede and spring 
And to here þe foules sing. 
þai sett hem doun al þre 
Under a fair ympetre, 
And wel sone þis fair quene 
Fel on slepe opon þe grene. 
þe maidens durst hir nouȝt awake, 
Bot lete hir ligge and rest take. 
So sehe slepe til afternone, 
þat undertide was al ydone. 
Ac so sone as sehe gan awake, 
Sehe crid and loþli bere gan make, 
Sehe froted hir honden and hir fet, 
And crached hir visage, it bled wete. 
Hir riche robe hye al torett 
And was reneyd out of hir witt. 
þe tvo maidens hir biside 
No durst wiþ hir no leng abide, 
Bot ourn to þe palays ful riȝt 
And told boþe squier and kniȝt, 
þat her quen awede wold, 
And bad hem go and hir at hold. 
Kniȝtes urn and levedis also, 
Damisels sexti and mo, 
In þe orchard to þe quen hye come 
And her up in her armes nome 
And brouȝt hir to bed atte last 
And held hir þere fine fast. 
Ac ever sehe held in o cri 
And wold up and owy. 
When Orfeo herd þat tiding 
Never him nas wers for noþing, 
He come wiþ kniȝtes tene 
To chaumber riȝt bifor þe quene 
And biheld and seyd wiþ grete pite: 
"O lef liif, what is te? 
þat ever ȝete hast ben so stille 
And now gredest wonderschille ! 
þi bodi, þat was so white ycore, 
Wiþ þine nailes is al totore! 
Alas þi rode, þat was so red, 
Is as wan as þou were ded! 
And also þine fingres smale 
Beþ al blodi and al pale! 
Alias! þi lovesum eyȝen to 
Lokeþ so man doþ on his fo! 
A dame, ich biseche merci! 
Lete ben al þis reweful cri, 
And tel me, what þe is and hou, 
And what þing may þe help now!" 
þo lay sche stille atte last 
And gan to wepe swiþe fast 
And seyd þus þe king to: 
"Alias, mi lord, sir Orfeo! 
Seþþen we first togider were, 
Ones wroþ never we nere; 
Bot ever ich have yloved þe 
As mi liif, and so þou me. 
Ac now we mot delen ato, 
Do þi best, for y mot go!" 
"Alias", quaþ he, "forlorn ich am! 
Whider wiltow go and to wham? 
Whider þou gost, ichil wip þe 
And whider y go, þou schalt wiþ me." 
"Nay, nay, sir, þat nouȝt nis, 
Ichil þe telle al hou it is: 
As ich lay þis undertide 
And slepe under our orchardside, 
þer come to me to fair kniȝtes 
Wele yarmed al to riȝtes 
And bad me comen an heiȝing 
And speke wiþ her lord þe king. 
And ich answerd at wordes hold, 
Y durst nouȝt no y nold. 
þai priked oȝain, as þai miȝt drive; 
þo kom her king al so blive 
Wiþ an hundred kniȝtes and mo 
And damisels an hundred also; 
AI on snowewhite stedes, 
As white as milke were her wedes. 
Y no seiȝe never ȝete bifore 
So fair creatours ycore: 
þe king hadde a croun on hed, 
It nas of silver no of gold red, 
Ac it was of a precious ston, 
As briȝt as þe sonne it schon. 
And as son as he to me cam, 
Wold ich, nold ich, he me nam 
And made me wiþ him ride 
Opon a palfray bi bis side 
And brouȝt me to bis palays, 
Wele atird in ich ways, 
And schewed me castels and tours, 
Rivers, forestes, friþ wiþ flours 
And bis riehe stedes icbon, 
And seþþen me brouȝt oȝain hom 
Into our owhen orchard 
And said to me þus afterward: 
"Loke, dame, to morwe þatow be 
Riȝt bere under þis ympetre, 
And þan þou schalt wiþ ous go 
And live wiþ ous ever mo. 
And ȝif þou makest ous ylet, 
Whar þou be, þou worst yfet, 
And totore þine limes al 
þat noþing belp þe no schal; 
And þei þou best so totorn, 
ȝete þou worst wiþ ous yborn." 
When king Orfeo herd þis cas, 
"Owe", quaþ he, "alias allas! 
Lever me were to lete mi liif 
þan þus to lese þe quen mi wiif!" 
He asked conseyl at ich man,' 
Ac no man him help no can. 
Amorwe þe undertide is come, 
And Orfeo haþ his armes ynome, 
And wele ten hundred kniȝtes wiþ him, 
Ich yarmed stout and grim, 
And wiþ þe quen wenten he 
Riȝt unto þat ympetre. 
þai made scheltrom in ich aside 
And sayd þai wold þere abide, 
And dye þer everichon, 
Er þe quen schuld from hem gon. 
Ac ȝete amiddes hem ful riȝt 
þe quen was oway ytviȝt, 
Wiþ fairi forþ ynome, 
Men wist never wher sche was bicome. 
þo was þer criing wepe and wo! 
þe king into his chaumber is go 
And oft swoned opon þe ston 
And made swiche diol and swiche mon, 
þat neiȝe bis liif was yspent, 
þer was no amendement; 
He cleped togider bis barouns, 
Erls, lordes of renouns. 
And when þai al ycomen were, ' 
"Lordinges", he said, "bifor ȝou here 
Ich ordainy min heiȝe steward 
To wite mi kingdom afterward, 
In mi stede ben be schal, 
To kepe mi londes over al. 
for now ichave mi quen ylore, 
þe fairest levedi, þat ever was bore. 
Never eft y nil no woman se, 
Into wildernes ichil te 
And live þer ever more 
Wiþ wilde bestes in holtes hore. 
And when ȝe understond, þat y be spent, 
Make ȝou þan a parlement 
And chese ȝou a newe king. 
Now doþ ȝour best wiþ al mi þing!" 
þo was þer wepeing in pe halle 
And grete cri among hem alle, 
Unneþe miȝt old or ȝong 
For wepeing speke a word wiþ tong. 
þai kneled adoun al yfere 
And praid him, ȝif his wille were, 
þat he no schuld fram hem go. 
"Do way", quaþ he, "it schal be so." 
AI his kingdom he forsoke, 
Bot a sclavin on him te toke, 
He ne hadde kirtel no hode, 
Schert non oper gode. 
Bot his harp he tok algate 
And dede him barfot out atte ȝate, 
No man most wiþ him go. 
Oway, what þer was wepe and wo, 
When he, þat hadde ben king wiþ croun, 
Went so poverlich out of toun! 
þurch wode and over heþ 
Into þe wildernes he geþ. 
Noþing he fint þat him is ays, 
Bot ever he liveþ in gret malais. 
He, þat hadde ywed þe fowe and griis 
And on bed þe purper-biis, 
Now on hard hepe he liþ, 
Wiþ leves and gresse he him wriþ. 
He, þat hadde had castels and tours, 
River, forest, friþ wiþ flours, 
Now, þei it comenci to snewe and frese, 
þis king mote make his bed in mese. 
He, þat had yhad kniȝtes of priis 
Bifor him kneland and levedis, 
Now seþ he noþing pat him likeþ, 
Bot wilde wormes bi him strikeþ. 
He, þat had yhad plente 
Of mete and drink of ich deynte, 
Now may he al day digge and wrote. 
Er he finde his fille of rote. 
In somer he livefþ bi wild frut 
And berren bot gode lite; 
In winter may he noþing finde 
Bot rote, grases and þe rinde. 
AI his bodi was oway dvine 
For missays and al tochine. 
Lord! who may telle þe sore, 
þis king sufferd ten ȝere and more! 
His here of his berd blac and rowe 
To his girdel-stede was growe. 
His harp, whereon was al his gle, 
He hidde in an holwe tre; 
And when þe weder was clere and briȝt, 
He toke his harp to him wel riȝt 
And harped at his owhen wille; 
Into alle þe wode þe soun gan schille, 
þat alle þe wilde bestes, þat þer beþ, 
For joie abouten him þai teþ. 
And alle þe foules þat þer were 
Come and sete on ich a brere, 
To here his harping afine, 
So miche melody was þerin. 
And when he his harping lete wold, 
No best bi him abide nold. 
He miȝt se him bisides 
Oft in hot undertides 
þe king o Fairi wiþ his rout 
Com to bunt him al about 
Wiþ dun cri and bloweing 
And houndes also wiþ him berking. 
Ac no best þai no nome, 
No never he nist whider þai bicome. 
And oþer while he miȝt him se 
As a gret ost bi him te, 
Wele atoumed ten hundred kniȝtes, 
Ich yarmed to his riȝtes, 
Of contenaunce stout and fers, 
Wip mani desplaid baners, 
And ich his swerd ydrawe hold, 
Ac never he nist whider þai wold. 
And oþer while he seiȝe oþer þing:
Kniȝtes and levedis com daunceing 
In queynt atire gisely, 
Queynt pas and softly; 
Tabours and trimpes ȝede hem bi 
And al maner menstraci.
And on a day he seiȝe him biside 
Sexti levedis on hors ride, 
Gentil and jolif as brid on ris,
Nouȝt man amonges hem þer nis. 
And ich a faucoun on hond bere
And riden on haukin bi o rivere; 
Of game þai founde wel gode haunt: 
Maulardes, hayroun and cormeraunt. 
þe foules of þe water ariseþ, 
þe faucouns hem wele deviseþ,
Ich faucoun his pray slouȝ. 
þat seiþe Orfeo and Iouȝ. 
"Parfay", quaþ he, "þer is fair game, 
þider ichil bi godes name; 
Ich was ywon swiche werk to se." 
He aros and þider gan te. 
To a levedi he was ycome, 
Biheld and haþ wele undernome
And seþ bi al þing, þat it is 
His owhen quen dam Heurodis. 
ȝern he biheld hir, and sche him eke, 
Ac noiþer to oþer a word no speke. 
Por messais, þat sche on him seiȝe, 
þat had ben so riche and so heiȝe, 
þe teres fei out of her eiȝe. 
þe oþer levedis þis yseiȝe 
And maked hir oway to ride; 
Sche most wiþ him,no lenger abide. 
"Alias", quaþ he, "now me is wo! 
Whi nil deþ now me slo! 
Alias wreche, þat y no miȝt 
Dye now after þis siȝt! 
Alias, to long last mi liif, 
When y no dar nouȝt wiþ mi wiif 
No hye to me o word speke. 
Alias, whi nil min hert breke! 
Parfay", quaþ he, "tide wat bitide, 
Whider so þis levedis ride, 
þe selve way ichil streche, 
Of liif no deþ me no reche!" 
His sclavain he dede on al so spac
And henge his harp opon his bac 
And had wel gode wil to gon, 
He no spard noiþer stub no ston. 
In at a roche þe leuedis rideþ, 
And he after and nouȝt abideþ. 
When he was in þe roche ygo, 
Wele pre mile oþer mo, 
He com into a fair cuntray. 

ȝ50 As brist so sonne on somers day, 

Smoþe and piain and al grene, 

Hille no dale was |>er non ysene. 

Amidde þe lond a castel he sise: 

Riche and real and wonder heise, 
ȝ55 AI þe utmast wal 

Was clere and schine as cfistal. 

An hundred tours þer were about 

Degiselich and bataild stout; 

]}e butras com out of þe diche, 
ȝ60 Of rede gold yarched riche; 

þe bonsour was avowed al 

Of ich maner divers animal. 

Wiþin þer wer wide wones 

AI of precious stones. 
ȝ65 þe werst piler on to biholde 

Was al of burnist gold. 

AI pat lond was ever liȝt, 

For when it schuld be þerk and niþt,

ȝ70 As briȝt as dof) at none ]}e sonne. 
No man may teile no þenche in þ0Uȝt

Bi al þing him þink, þat it is 
þe proude court of paradisT 

ȝ75 In þis castel þe levedis aliȝt; 
He wold in after ȝif he miȝt. 
Orfeo knokkeþ atte gate, 
þe porter was redi þerate 
And asked, what he wold have ydo: 

ȝ80 "Parfay", quaf) he, "icham a minstrel, lo! 
To solas ])i lord wiþ mi gle, 
ȝif his siiete wille be." 
þe porter undede þe ȝate anon 
And lete him into þe castel gou. 

ȝ85 þan he gan biliold about al 

And seiȝe ful liggeand wiþin þe wal 
Of folk, þat were þider ybrouȝt 
And þouȝt dede and nere nouȝt; 
Sum stode wiþouten bade,

And sum fiurch pe bodi hadde wounde, 

And sum lay wode ybounde, 

And sum armed on hors sete, 

And sum astrangled, as pai ete,

And lium wip fire al forsclireynt;

Sum ded, and sum awedde; 

And wonder feie jþer lay bisides,

Eche was þU8 in pis warld ynome, 

Wiþ fairi þider ycome. 

per he seiȝe his owhen wiif 

Dame Heurodis his liif liif 
405 Slepe under an ympetre, 

Bi her clojþes he knewe, pat it was he. 

And when he hadde bihold pis mervails alle, 

He went into pe kinges halle. 

þan seiȝe he þer a semly 8iȝt: 
410 A tabernacle bliþeful and briȝt,

And her quen fair and swete. 

Her crounes, her cloþe8 schine so briȝt,

415 When he hadde biholden al þat þing, 

He kneled adoun bifor [)e king: 

"O lord", he seyd, "þif it þi wille were, 

Mi menstraci þou schust yhere." 

þe king answerd: "What man artow,

Ich no non, þat is wip me,

Seþþen þat ich here regni gan,

Bot þat ichim wold ofsende." 
"Lord", quaþ he, "trowe ful wel,

And, sir, it is ]þe maner of ous 

4ȝ0 To seche mani a lordes hous; 
þei we nouȝt welcom no be, 
ȝete we mot proferi forþ our gle." 
Bifor þe king he sat adoun 
And tok bis harp so miri of soun 

4ȝ5 And tempreþ bis harp, as he wele can, 
And bliþeful notes he þer gan,

Com to him forto here, 
And liggef) adoun to his fete,

1)6 king herkneþ and sitt ful stille, 
To here his gle he haf) gode wille, 
Gode bourde he hadde of his gle,

445 When he hadde stint his harping,

"Sir'S he seyd, "ich biseche jþe,

455 "Nay", quaþ jþe king, "pat nouȝt nere! 
A sori couple of ȝ0U it were, 
For þou art lene, rowe and blac, 
And sehe is lovesum wiþouten lac. 
A loþlich þing it were for þi

"0 sir", he seyd, "gentil king,

So, sir, as ȝe seyd nouþe,

And nedes þ0u most þi word hold/' 
þe king seyd: "Seþþen it is so, 
Take hir bi þe hond and go. 
Of hir ichil þatow be bliþe." 

470 He knelyd adoun and þonked him swiþe, 
His wiif he tok bi þe hond 
And dede him swiþe out of þat lond 
And went him out of þat þede, 
Riȝt as he come þe way he ȝede. 
475 So long he haþ þe way ynome, 

To Traciens he is ycome,

Ac no man knewe, þat it was he. \ 

No forþer þsm þe tounes ende

'Bot wiþ a begger ybilt ful narwe,

To him and to his owhen wiif 

As a minstrel of pover liif, þ 

485* And asked tidings of þat lond, 

And who þe kingdom held in hond.

Told him everich a grot: 

How her quen was stole owy,

And hou her king in exile ȝede, 1 

Bot so man nist in wiche þede, 

And hou þe steward þe lond gan hold, 

And oþer mani þinges him told. 
495 Amorwe oȝain none tide 
He maked his wiif þer abide,

And heng his harp his rigge opon 

And went him into þat cite, 
500 þat men miȝt him bihold and se: 

Erls and barouns bold 

Buriays and levedis him gan bihold. 

"Lo", þai seyd, "swiche a man! 

Hoiv long þe here hongeþ him opan! 
505 Lo, hou his berd hongeþ to his kne! 

He is yclongen al so a tre!" 

And as he ȝede in þe «trete, 

Wiþ his Steward he gan mete, 

And loude he sett on him a crie: 
510 "Sir Steward", he seyd, "merci! 

Ich am an harpour of heþeni8se, 

Help me now in þis destreþe!" 

þe Steward seyd: "Com wiþ me come. 

Of þat ichave þou schalt have some. 
515 Everich gode harpour is welcom me to 

Por mi lordes love, sir Orfeo." 

In þe castel þe steward sat atte niete, 
And many lording was bi him sete. 
þer were trompour and tabourers, 

520 Harpours feie and crouders. 
Miche melody þei maked alle, 
And Orfeo sat stille in þe halle 
And herkneþ. When þei ben al stille, 
He toke his harp and tempred schille, 

525 þe bliþefulest notes he harped þere, 
þat ever ani man yherd wiþ ere; 
Ich man liked wele his gle. 
þe Steward biheld and gan yse 
And knewe þe harp als blive: 

5ȝ0 "Menstrel", he seyd, "so mot þou þrive, 
Where hadestow þi8 harp and hou? 
Y pray þat þou me teile now." 
"Lord", quaþ he, "in uncouþe þede

Wiþ lyouns a man totom smale. 

And wolves him frete wiþ tep so scharp. 

Bi him Y fond þis ich harp; 
Wele ten ȝere it is ygo." 
540 "0", quaþ þe steward, "now me is wo!

Away, þat ich was ybore!

And so vile deþ ymarked!" 

Adoun he fei aswon to grounde, 

His barouns him toke up in þat stounde 

And telleþ him hou it geþ, 
550 It nis no bot of manes deþ. 

King Orfeo knewe wele bif)an 

His Steward was a trewe man, 

And loved him, as he auþt to do. 

And stont up and seyt Jus: ,,Lo,

ȝif ich were Orfeo þe king. 

And hadde ysuffred ful ȝore 

In wilderniþe miche sore,

And ȝif þou of mi deþ hadest ben bliþe,

þo al þo, þat þerin sete,

575 And þe steward him wele knewe, 

Over and over þe bord he þrewe 

And fei adoun to his fet, \ 

So dede everich lord, þat þer sete, 

And al þai seyd at criing:

Glad þai were of his live, 
To chaumber þai ladde him als blive 
And baþed him and schaved his berd 
Aiid tired him as a king apert.

Por joie þai wepe wiþ her eiȝe,

And made herof a lay of gode likeing 
And nempned it after þe king:
