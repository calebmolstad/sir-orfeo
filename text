We redyn ofte and fynde ywryte, 
As clerkes don us to wyte, 
þe layes þat ben of harpyng 
Ben yfounde of frely þing, 
Sunt ben of wele and sunt of wo, 
And sum of joy and merþe also, 
Sum of trechery and sum of gyle, 
And sum of happes, þat fallen by whyle, 
Sunt of bourdys and sum of rybaudry, 
And sum þer ben of þe feyre. 
Off alle þing þat men may se, 
Moost o lowe forsoþe þey be. 
In Brytain þis layes arne ywryte, 
Furst yfounde and forþe ygete, 
Of aventures þat fillen by dayes 
Wherof Brytouns made her layes, 
When þey myght owher heryn 
Of aventures þat þer weryn, 
þey toke her harpys wiþ game, 
Maden layes and ȝaf it name, 
Of aventures, þat han befalle, 
Y can sunt telle, but nought all 
Herken, lordyngs, þat ben trewe, 
And y wol ȝou telle of sir Orphewe. 
Orfeo was a king, 
In his time an heiȝe lording, 
A stalworþ man and hardi bo, 
Large, curteys he was also. 
His fader was comen of king Pluto 
And his moder of king Juno, 
þat sum time were as godes yhold 
For aventours, þat þai dede and told. 
Orpheo most of ony þing 
Lovede þe gle of harpyng; 
Syker was every gode harpoure 
Of hym to have moche honour. 
Hymself loved for to harpe 
And layde þereon his wittes scharpe, 
He lernyd so, þer noþing was 
A better harper in no plas. 
In þe world was never man born 
þat ever Orpheo sat biforn, 
And he myȝt of his harpyng her, 
He schulde þinke þat he wer 
In one of þe joys of paradys, 
Suche joy and melody in his harpyng is, 
þis king soiurnd in Traciens, 
þat was a cite of noble defens; 
He hadde wiþ him a quen of priis, 
þat was ycleped dame Heurodis, 
þe fairest levedi for þe nones 
þat miȝt gon on bodi and bones, 
Ful of love and of godenisse, 
Ac no man may telle hir fairnise. 
Bifel so in þe comessing of May, 
When miri and bot is þe day,
Oway beþ winterschours, 
And everi feld is ful of flours, 
And blosme breme on everi bouȝ 
Overal wexeþ miri anouȝ, 
þis ich quen dame Heurodis 
Tok to maidens of priis 
And went in an undrentide 
To play bi an orchardside,
To se þe floures sprede and spring 
And to here þe foules sing. 
þai sett hem doun al þre 
Under a fair ympetre, 
And wel sone þis fair quene 
Fel on slepe opon þe grene. 
þe maidens durst hir nouȝt awake, 
Bot lete hir ligge and rest take. 
So sehe slepe til afternone, 
þat undertide was al ydone. 
Ac so sone as sehe gan awake, 
Sehe crid and loþli bere gan make, 
Sehe froted hir honden and hir fet, 
And crached hir visage, it bled wete. 
Hir riche robe hye al torett 

80 And was reneyd out of hir witt. 
I)e tvo maidens hir biside 
No durst wij) hir no leng abide, 
Bot ourn to ^e palays ful ri3t 
And told bo|)e squier and kni3t, 

85 |)at her quen awede wold, 

. And bad hem go and hir at hold. 
Kni3te8 um and levedis also, 
Damisels sexti and mo, 
In |)e orchard to |)e quen hye come 

90 And her up in her armes nome 
And brou3t hir to bed atte last 
And held hir I)ere fine fast. 
Ac ever sehe held in o cri 
And wold up and owy. 
95 When Orfeo herd I)at tiding 
Never him nas wers for noj)ing, 
He come wi|) kni3te8 tene 
To chaumber ri3t bifor |)e quene 
And biheld and seyd wij) grete pite: 

100 „O lef lüf, what is te? 

I)at ever 3ete hast ben so stille 
And now gredest wonderschille !

115 {)o lay sehe stille atte last 

And gan to wepe swij)e fast 

And seyd pus |)e king to:

125 „Alias", quaj) he, „forlorn ich am!

„Nay, nay, sir, l)at nou3t nis,

And speke wij) her lord j)e king. 
And ich answerd at wordes hold, 
Y durst nou3t no y nold. 
I)ai priked 03ain, as J)ai mi3t drive; 

140 |)o kom her king al so blive

And damisels an hundred also; 
AI on snowewhite stedes, 
As white as milke were her wedes. 

145 Y no sei3e never 3ete hifore 
So fair creatours ycore: 
J)e king hadde a croun on hed, 
It nas of silver no of gold red, 
Ac it was of a precious ston, 

150 As bri3t as J)e sonne it schon. 
And as son as he to me cam, 
Wold ich, nold ich, he me nam 

And made me wif) him ride 

Opon a palfray bi bis side 
155 And brou3t me to bis palays,

When king Orfeo herd J)is cas,

He asked conseyl at ich man,'

225 AI his kingdom he forsoke, 

Bot a sclavin on him te toke, 

He ne hadde kirtel no hode, 

Schert non oper gode. 

Bot his Aarp he tok algate

No man most wij) him go. 
Oway, what ^er was wepe and wo,

His here of his berd blac and rowe 
To his girdel-stede was growe. 

265 His harp, whereon was al his gle, 
He hidde in an holwe tre; 
And when J)e weder was clere and bri3t, 
He toke his harp to him wel ri3t 
And harped at his owhen wille;
